# BratMUN-print-server
This project is being created for its usage during the annual BratMUN conference (Bratislava Model United Nations). We are hoping that it will be ready for this year, 2015, and that it will come handy to the next generations of IB students from GJH.

**Functions:**

1.Downloading attachments from Gmail(possibly any other email service)<br>
2.Printing of the downloaded attachments<br>
3.Nice summary of the status of all the printjobs that arrived.<br>
4.Archivation of all the messages<br>
5.Statistics(e.g. num. of printed pages etc.)
